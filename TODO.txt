-Easy way = using SMS to send status messages to all players automatically.

-Hard/fancy way = using Azure or something similar to store game session data
 on a server.

-Finish Contacts selection. It should show selected contacts to user in a
 readable format on the "Start Game" page.

-Ensure that only one game is running at a time.

-Define roles of players more prominently/have explanations in-app. (Separate
 activity, maybe?)



TODO 2: Hackathon Boogaloo
==========================

-We have a Twilio account registered to marcus.fedarko@gmail.com.

-We have an OpenShift account registered to marcus.fedarko@gmail.com.

-We have a server set up for Openshift, available in the browser at http://smspi-smspidemiic.rhcloud.com/

-We need to link everything together, and deploy Node.js code to our server.

Our app should store data on our server, and our server should have the functionality available
to trigger Twilio SMS's to the players' phones.

-Finish contacts - get phone # (imperative) and name (easier, but less important).
