==========

Max Players: 25 (theoretically, unlimited, but 25 should prevent this from
getting out-of-hand - feel free to limit the maximum further.)

Min Players: 5

1) User #1 ("host" - only one required to have the application installed)
   starts a game instance.
    A) Uses a certain number of contacts (e.g. 10 people's phone numbers)
       as input.

2) All players get a SMS text saying that the game has begun (with host-
   provided text alongside this).

3) Players are assigned statuses:
    *10% of players begin as "doctors". 
        -Uninfected by default.
        -High resistance to disease; still possible to get infected, but
         unlikely (esp. when compared to neutral players).
        -Upon SMS contact with an incubating player, the incubating player
         reverts to "neutral".

    *60% of players begin as "neutral".
        -Uninfected by default.
        -Upon SMS contact with an infected player, the neutral player becomes
         "incubating".

    *30% of players begin as "infected".
        -Notified at the start that they are infected. Their score comes from
         infecting other people; unlike the others, their goal isn't to stay
         alive, but to spread the epidemic as much as possible.
        -Infected at the start.
        -Upon SMS contact with a neutral player, the neutral player becomes
         "incubating".

    *10% of players begin as "incubating".
        -In a sort of "middle ground". They've been given the disease, but it
         hasn't been spread throughout their body yet.
        -Upon SMS contact with a doctor player, the incubating player reverts
         to "neutral".
        -Incubating players can't infect players, and they can't get more sick.
         They're essentially neutral, but with a time limit.
        -If two days pass since incubation time without being cured via a
         doctor, the player becomes "dead".
        
    *0% of players begin as "dead".
        -Dead players get notifications about end-of-game notices; e.g. "[P1]
         won the game by surviving!" or "[I1 and I2] won the game by infecting
         [n] people."
        -Nobody starts as being dead. Because that would be pretty silly.

4) Over the course of the week (7 days or 168 hours since the host started the
   game), people can communicate like normal via SMS.
